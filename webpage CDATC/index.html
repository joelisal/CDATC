            The Democratic Republic of Congo is a land filled with continental
            dimensions whose generous nature synthesizes the climates of the
            tropical world. It is a geological scandal, a gift, a divine
            providence that workers and peasants watch with circumspection
            without always tasting its flavor. <br />Thus, privileged
            beneficiaries of experiences accumulated since the beginnings of
            Congolese trade unionism, intellectual and manual workers, urban and
            rural, are unanimous in marking, from now on, a new stage of the
            movement. <br />
            Supporting the universal principle according to which work is an
            obligation, that is to say a sacred duty of men, they undertake to
            work because of their very humanity whose subsistence and
            development require work. <br />They must work out of consideration
            for their neighbors, especially for their families, for the society
            to which they belong, for the entire human family. <br />
            Freely and in solidarity, they proclaim the revaluation of the
            Congolese union by adapting it to national realities through the
            establishment of more modern methods of union action fundamentally
            focused on decentralization, consultation and clear responsibility
            at the base. <br />
            They spontaneously resemble each other within the: â€œAlarm Cries of
            Consumptive Workers(CDATC) in acronym for examining the future from
            the past and defining the means to achieve their objectives. This
            questioning constitutes a development of the working man resulting
            from the organizational capacity of society which, to do this,
            campaigned from the base to the top. <br />
            United within the CDATC, the workers firmly and consciously maintain
            that their organization is democratic and sustainable, based on
            dynamism, combativeness, discipline and integrity with a view to
            good social justice. They want it to be free from all kinds of
            discrimination (social, tribal, regional, gender and religion).
            <br />
            the CDATC, in the spirit of independence from the government of
            employers and political parties, is respectful of all opinions, both
            political and philosophical, is committed to working and
            establishing itself among men in a society where everyone's rights
            are respected.

          the CDATC has the sacred mission of improving the living and working
          conditions of its members through collective negotiation by making the
          worker an artisan, a beneficiary of the socio-economic development of
          the company and the nation;It bases the roots and consolidation of its
          action on and through intensive permanent training and objective
          information for the orientation of its members; It is committed to
          giving its members and activists the assurance of solidarity in an
          essential collective power to protect them against injustices of all
          kinds; It gives meaning to families and social interests through
          better child protection, better education and schooling conditions,
          better social and health services, the establishment of a fairer, more
          peaceful and peaceful society. more progressive: <br /> It intends to
          ensure the promotion of the social economy including non-trading
          activities for real purchasing power and to pay sustained attention to
          the most vulnerable categories of workers in both the structured and
          unstructured sectors, agricultural workers, self-employed workers,
          young workers, people with disabilities and workers at the end of
          their careers. Their dignity must be the subject of concern and
          special measures: <br /> It is committed to fighting within the
          framework of national, African and international working class
          solidarity to contribute to the liberation and promotion of the
          working class in general; She reaches out to other progressive and
          democratic union organizations to exert influence on political
          institutions and finally to ensure better living conditions for those
          who work: <br />An essential factor in economic stability and
          progress, the CDATC is for social peace. It requires loyal and
          dignified behavior from its members and social partners, based on a
          perfect knowledge of duties and respect for rights so that peace,
          justice and work reign forever.
